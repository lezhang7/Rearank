[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Overview

Rearank is a sophisticated large language model (LLM)-based listwise reasoning reranking agent that revolutionizes information retrieval through explicit reasoning. Built on top of Qwen2.5-7B, Rearank demonstrates performance comparable to GPT-4 while requiring minimal annotated samples.

## Key Features

- **Explicit Reasoning**: Incorporates a listwise reasoning approach before reranking, enhancing both performance and interpretability
- **Efficient Training**: Achieves state-of-the-art results with only 179 annotated samples
- **Advanced Architecture**: Built on Qwen2.5-7B foundation model
- **Strong Performance**: Comparable to GPT-4 on various benchmarks
- **Versatility**: Excels in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios
- **Superior Reasoning**: Outperforms GPT-4 on reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmarks

## Technical Highlights

- Leverages reinforcement learning for enhanced reasoning capabilities
- Implements innovative data augmentation techniques
- Demonstrates significant improvements over baseline models
- Specialized in information retrieval tasks
